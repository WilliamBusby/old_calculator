## Description
This is copied from an old commit of https://github.com/WilliamBusby/calculator with updated styling changes. 

This does not include the added functions that responsiveness included.

Calculator that works using Javascript functions and eventListeners for each of the buttons. 

Has the option to use either left-to-right (LTR) or bracket-order-division-multiplication-addition-subtraction (BODMAS) solving.

Very minor responsiveness added at min-width 600px and 990px to show additional functions.
